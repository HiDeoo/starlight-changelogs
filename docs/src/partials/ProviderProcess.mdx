{props.children}

**Type:** `({ name }: { name: string }) => string | undefined`

Sets an optional function called for every version entry in the changelog which can be used to either modify the version title or filter out certain versions.

The function receives the version title found in the changelog and can use it to return an updated title or `undefined` to filter out this specific version.

Filtering out versions can be useful for example when using the GitHub provider on a monorepo publishing releases for multiple packages, and only changes for a specific package should be shown in the changelog.

For example, considering a changelog with the following version titles:

- `v1.0.1`
- `v1.0.1-beta.1`
- `v1.0.0`
- `v0.1.1`
- `v0.1.0`

The following example will filter out the beta version and strip the `v` prefix from the version titles:

```ts
changelogsLoader([
  {
    process: ({ title }) => {
      // If the version title contains "-beta", filter it out.
      if (title.includes('-beta')) return

      // Otherwise, strip the "v" prefix from the version title,
      // e.g. "v1.0.0" becomes "1.0.0".
      return title.replace(/^v/, '')
    },
  },
])
```
