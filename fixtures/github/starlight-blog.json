Two new behaviors are now available:\n\n    -   `header-start` — Adds a link to the blog after the site title or logo in the header on large viewports. On smaller viewports, a link to the blog is added to the mobile menu sidebar for non-blog pages.\n    -   `none` — Does not add any links to the blog and it is up to the user to add links to the blog wherever they want.\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n-   [#139](https://github.com/HiDeoo/starlight-blog/pull/139) [`6ed1559`](https://github.com/HiDeoo/starlight-blog/commit/6ed15599bf075feeac4165e57d56b86967d72ad2) Thanks [@HiDeoo](https://github.com/HiDeoo)! - Fixes an inconsistency in blog post ordering for posts with the same date.\n\n    Blog posts are now consistently ordered by their [`date`](https://starlight-blog-docs.vercel.app/guides/frontmatter/#date-required) in descending order, and then by their [`title`](https://starlight-blog-docs.vercel.app/guides/frontmatter/#title-required) in ascending order if the dates are identical.\n"

If you were manually rendering `starlight-blog/overrides/Sidebar.astro` in a custom override, you can now remove it.\r\n\r\n-   [#111](https://github.com/HiDeoo/starlight-blog/pull/111) [`144e6b2`](https://github.com/HiDeoo/starlight-blog/commit/144e6b2cad8ff011806f9b8d5bb7f609f7e8fc13) Thanks [@HiDeoo](https://github.com/HiDeoo)! - Adds a blog data object accessible on Starlight pages using `Astro.locals.starlightBlog` containing information about all the blog posts in your project. This can be useful for example to create a widget that lists recent blog posts on your homepage.\r\n\r\n    See the [“Blog Data” guide](https://starlight-blog-docs.vercel.app/guides/blog-data/) for more information.\r\n\r\n-   [#111](https://github.com/HiDeoo/starlight-blog/pull/111) [`144e6b2`](https://github.com/HiDeoo/starlight-blog/commit/144e6b2cad8ff011806f9b8d5bb7f609f7e8fc13) Thanks [@HiDeoo](https://github.com/HiDeoo)! - Fixes a regression introduced in version `0.16.0` of the plugin where the generated RSS feed no longer included content of blog posts due to a bug in Astro.\r\n"
